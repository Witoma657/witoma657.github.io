					<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Far away from</span> anything fast and busy, further past any roads or paths, hidden far within the rolling hills, and below the hilltops, was a deep forest with a quiet village dwelling near its edge. The evening was calm and crisp, not unlike the last several, but as the moon rose, the stars, that had always been brilliant, came out dim, burnt, and tired. The sky, in tune with the stars, was troubled with a sickly color that forebode something extraordinary was coming. A moment passed, and a mysterious bright light was seen shooting across the sky and scraping the clouds. Just as the village folk were retreating to their nightly rituals, through their windowpanes they saw the strange streak in the sky. It was dazzling at first glance, as nothing had been so exciting in so long, but it was getting closer, quicker than any pace the folk were used to. As fast as they were able, first a stirring was made, and then a commotion. Their humble alarm bell, that hung weary in the center of all their doors, was fatigued by the many moons it had seen without urgency, but it did ring. It rang so that all would know of the comet’s arrival before making its devastating introduction. Although the bell tolled at its best, the sound wasn’t enough to reach those who happened to be deeper within the forest.</p>

					<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">She was collecting</span> firewood for her family before the dark and cold night settled in. She felt safe under the shades of the strong trunks that had been there generations before her, but all of a sudden the ground started to rumble and all around her the strong trunks were challenged by a great and hot wind that flooded through all of the gaps and spaces, and the forest swayed and moaned. Within a few short moments, she then felt the crash. It was there that she was the only witness as the majority of the trunks surrendered their leaves, and like a fallen warrior’s blood spills, their pieces trickled down in cinders and danced all around her. After all that was in the air settled down, it formed a soft grey blanket that was shifted over the ground. That part of the mighty forest was nothing more than burnt bones flickering with flames and puffing smoke, but in the distance, between the remains of the fallen ancients, she could see a green glow that seemed to beckon to her. She followed the source of the green light, and struggled her way through the debris and clouds of extinguishing biological carnage. Eventually she came upon the place where it had all started, in a circular clearing in the forest, with a freshly scorched and searing crater in center.</p>

					<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Within the crater</span> she could see a small fire, glowing an odd shade of bright green. As she gazed at the fire, it’s flames swayed in such a way that she felt herself becoming almost spellbound by it. An icy wind swept through, and she realized just how cold she was and how dark it had gotten. The small fire, freshly charred in the cold earth, looked all the more inviting.</p>
					<p class="indent">She stumbled her way down the rocky crater to the edge of the small fire and sat. Its flames were just enough to warm her fingertips, but nothing else. Taking some of the wood she had gathered, she threw it onto the fire. Yet, the fire did not grow. Puzzled by this, she remembered how she had learned that a bit of kindling was also required to feed a hungry flame. Without proper kindling, she thought about what could be used in its place. After inspecting the area around her, a strand of hair loosened itself in the bitter wind and fluttered near her cheek. Realizing she had what was missing all along, she cut off a lock of her hair and threw it into the fire. The fire started to spark and spit and suddenly it began to burst out violently, high above her head. It bloomed in magnificent flickering colors and rained down sparks as if they were its seeds. She had to take a step back from it, as she was so close before, but it was too late.</p>
					<p class="indent">The sparks had been showered over her, and ignited her hair. She screamed out as the flames engulfed her head, hissing and whirring, as her once short brown locks spiraled out into many long multicolored strands of hot crackling flame. The flames reached so tall, and burned so bright, that they ignited what was left of the trees above her and soon after, everything surrounding her was fiercely ablaze, and spreading. The only thing she could think to do amidst the flames was run, run back to her village to seek help. She ran and ran, stumbling and panting all along the way as her hair, now fully transformed into hot fire, continued to crack and sizzle. She ran back through the thick forest, once again ablaze, and as she ran she became more blinded by smoke and falling ash. The forest was now fighting a war, not just a battle, and it hissed and roared as giants fell, branches broke, and fire bellowed. She ran for what seemed like a lifetime, but she then saw the pale orange light of her humble home through a clearing in the trees. She glanced behind her towards the forest and realized a terrible truth. That as she ran, the long flames of her hair that were now burning brilliantly upon her head had left a path of fiery destruction that followed behind her. Like a slow shadow, the fire was creeping its way back towards her and her home. She desperately called out to her family, but they gave no answer. She ran over near the windowpanes to see if they were still inside, but the smoke and ash surrounding her face made it impossible. Tears burst from her eyes, but sizzled out as soon as they touched her cheeks, as her smooth skin boiled under the heat from her hair. All the noise from the dying forest and the flames surrounded her, snapping and whipping around her ears, was deafening. She knew that her home was about to be devoured and she could not do anything to help, as she herself now walked with fire.</p>

					<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">For a few moments</span> she stood motionless… and a great deal of vapor rose up from burning tears that trailed down her cheeks. Her ears rang, worn out from the white noise of the fire, but… slowly… very <i>very</i> slowly… she could hear a faint sound, like a gentle heartbeat… <i>thump… thump… thump… thump…</i> she was amazed that her own heartbeat was so calm amidst all the chaos, she listened <i>more… thump… thump… thump… ding… dong… ding… dong…</i> but it wasn’t her heartbeat at all. She could hear the old village bell ringing out, and she then realized that the fire had spread, much further than she had thought.</p>
					<p class="indent">She needed to know many things. She knew her family was smart and must’ve seen or heard the fire before she had arrived. They must’ve fled their home to the part of the village that was closer to the edge of the forest, where the grassy rolling hills kissed the ends of the tall trees. She needed to know if they were there; she needed to know if they and village was safe, and she needed to know just how much devastation she had caused. Saying goodbye to her childhood home, she changed course for the tallest hill that overlooked the village and chose a path with as few trees as possible, so that her destruction could be somewhat contained. All along the way her flames still burned, and her feverish skin still sweat, but she could still hear the distant sound of that bell… <i>ding… dong… ding… dong… </i> that once was a threatening sound to her, became a symbol of reassurance. For the bell must be rung to ring, and it rang all the way until she was nearing her final steps up the hill. It was in those final moments, that the encouraging sound of that bell faded, and then all she could hear was fire once again.</p>
					<p class="indent">Her heart began to race, and she ran the rest of the way up, up to the very top of the hill, where all of her small village could be seen, but when she finally arrived, she stopped. There was nothing left but black. Black burning smoke with black burning trees and little black burnt houses underneath. There were no pale orange lights that would shine behind tidy windowpanes to welcome her. The only orange lights that were visible were the few smaller fires that remained scattered and sputtering, consuming all that remained. The bell that had comforted her for the majority of her journey was nowhere to be seen, buried in the rubble. All was consumed by the fire and flames, and those flames were the kin of her own curse, sizzling and flickering more calmly now atop her head. Hot tears welled up, but there was no one left to console her, so she walked. She left the black behind her like a huge ugly shadow, and though the sun began to rise, the shadow stayed, but she keep walking. All through the rolling hills she walked, and the long flames that grew from her head and trailed behind her continued to burn, and her tears continued to boil, and her soft skin continued to temper, and she was cursed to roam the land as the girl who walked with fire.</p>
